codefortheplanet.org
====================

Serves as an inspiration and information tool for software developers wanting to make the world a little bit better.

The site at http://www.codefortheplanet.org is not yet considered "launched" ;-) This should happen in between the next 12 hours.

## System dependencies

The Ruby version (currently 2.1.4) will be chosen by the files Gemfile and .ruby-version.

You will need to install postgres as this is the database in use. On unix environments it's likely that you have to
install a development package as well, it might be called `libpq-dev`. Full installation instructions can be found
on the web for almost every imaginable combination. 

## Running the test suite

Nothing special

    bundle exec rake test

## Deployment instructions

The project is deployed via the heroku toolbelt. If you want to join the development regularly contact [@code4theplanet](http://twitter.com/code4theplanet) on twitter.

## Usage

There are quite some steps left necessary that are necessary to get the application up and running and which are not
documented yet. These should be documented soon, feel free to add your notes.

Things you may want to cover:

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* ...
