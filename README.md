codefortheplanet.org
====================

Serves as an inspiration and information tool for software developers wanting to make the world a little bit better.

The site at http://www.codefortheplanet.org is not yet considered "launched" ;-) This should happen in between the next 12 hours.

## System dependencies

The Ruby version (currently 2.1.4) will be chosen by the files Gemfile and .ruby-version.

You will need to install postgres as this is the database in use. On unix environments it's likely that you have to
install a development package as well, it might be called `libpq-dev`. Full installation instructions can be found
on the web for almost every imaginable combination. 

## Database Configuration & Setup

If you intend to have non-default database names or authentication set things up in `config/database.yml`

Run `rake db:setup` to let rails create the databases and run the migrations for you.
 
As soon as there are some seeds in `db/seeds.rb` to bootstrap you with data, you can run `rake db:seed` to
have it created. 

## Running test suite & server

Nothing special, to run the test suite

    bundle exec rake test

That server will boot up if you run

	bundle exec rails s

Currently there's an index.html maintenance page that will show up on the root route. You can either delete it or
go to /recipes

## Deployment instructions

The project is deployed via the heroku toolbelt. If you want to join the development regularly contact
