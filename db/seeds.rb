  Anonymity is increasingly important for networked applications amidst concerns over censorship and privacy.
  In this paper, we describe Herbivore, a peer-to-peer, scalable, tamper-resilient communication system that
  provides provable anonymity and privacy. Building on dining cryptographer networks, Herbivore scales by
  partitioning the network into anonymizing cliques. Adversaries able  to monitor all network traffic cannot
  deduce the identity of a sender or receiver beyond an anonymizing clique. In addition to strong anonymity,
  Herbivore simultaneously provides high efficiency and scalability, distinguishing it from other anonymous
  communication protocols. Performance measurements from a prototype implementation show that the system can
  achieve high bandwidths and low latencies when deployed over the Internet.',
